# Brainfuck Interpreter in C
This is a Brainfuck Interpreter written entirely in C. 
It takes a .b or .bf file (containing a brainfuck program) as input and constructs, compiles, and runs its equivalent C program.
Example outputs of inputs provided on https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Hello.2C_World.21 are provided.
(Note: I apologize for the language's name)
